open the note book combine.nb
. Then follow the steps in the notebook.

2.The channels in combine.nb are all independent channels for
sidis. The result for any other channel can be found identical to one
of the listed channels. The other channels not listed in Cancelpoles###.nb can be found in cntxsc.m

3.The correspondence between real and virtual channels is not one to one. The correspondence is as follows

       virtual                real
       Ag2qqb               Ag2qqbg
       Aq2qg           Aq2qgg,Aq2qqqb,Aq2qQQb
       Aq2gq                Aq2gqg
        none                Ag2gqqb
        none                Aq2qbqq
        none                Aq2QqQb 

where Aq2qg corresponds to 3 real channels. The reason is discussed in detail under Eq35 of Gordon's paper. Here the cancellation of single poles in this case agrees exactly with Gordon's discussion.

4.The calculation here is the g^{\mu\nu} projection of the partonic W tensor.
