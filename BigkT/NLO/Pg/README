  
# Some details of what is computed

1.To check cancellation of all poles for various sidis processes open the note
book combine.nb. Then follow the steps in the notebook.

2.The channels in combine.nb are all independent channels for sidis. The result
for any other channel can be found identical to one of the listed channels. The
other channels not listed in Cancelpoles###.nb can be found in cntxsc.m

3.The correspondence between real and virtual channels is not one to one. The
correspondence is as follows

       virtual                real
       Ag2qqb               Ag2qqbg
       Aq2qg           Aq2qgg,Aq2qqqb,Aq2qQQb
       Aq2gq                Aq2gqg
        none                Ag2gqqb
        none                Aq2qbqq
        none                Aq2QqQb 

where Aq2qg corresponds to 3 real channels. The reason is discussed in detail
under Eq35 of Gordon's paper. Here the cancellation of single poles in this
case agrees exactly with Gordon's discussion.

4.The calculation here is the g^{\mu\nu} projection of the partonic W tensor.


# From Mathematica to python 

1. The script combine.m produces different parts for each channel. The results are
stored in the folder mdata

2. The script combine.py takes the results stored inside mdata, add all the parts
and saves in string format in the folder channels, channel by channel 

3. The script code-gen.py takes the results from combine.py and generates python
   code. Currently labeled as chnX.py
